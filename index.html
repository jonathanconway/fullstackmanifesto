      <h1>The Full Stack Manifesto</h1>

      <p>It frustrates me that so many organisations continue to structure themselves around two antiquated kinds of relations between workers:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Specialisation</li>
        <li>Hierarchy</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This is <strong>last century's</strong> model of workplace organisation. This worked well for Henry Ford, because what was needed was highly repetitive, piecemeal work by masses of workers (specialisation) and a system of managers to supervise those workers (hierarchy).</p>

      <p>We are now moving into a very different economy. Yes, many of us are still building products – online software – for mass consumption. But the repetitive, piecemeal work is being automated away. The bits that aren't automated are precisely the bits that we need a full human being's active, engaged mind, to accomplish. This means that the worker has to be fully engaged in what they're doing, and able to understand it from a broader conceptual level, rather than just working on one single piece of it.</p>

      <p>Additionally, the non-functional aspects of software, for example how it scales, how it stores, data, etc. are becoming more and more offloaded to third-party frameworks and providers. For example, scalable hosting is done by cloud providers e.g. AWS, Azure. Rendering has been taken over by browser engines. Component libraries are plentiful, and we're gradually settling on a standard set of re-usable web components (e.g. inputs, buttons, etc).</p>

      <p>Why are we hiring a "front-end developer" whose <em>only focus</em> is the code that renders the UI? Then that person has to communicate with a "visual designer" on how the aesthetic should look, and with an "interaction designer" on what how the user will interact with the product, and with a "UX specialist" on how the user should experience the product.</p>

      <p>Can you see the problem here? There's tonnes of fragmentation, there's tonnes of communication overhead, none of these employees get to feel full ownership and engagement with their work, and the person who makes all the big critical decisions (usually some kind of "product manager", etc) is disconnected from the actual product being developed.</p>

      <p>Why couldn't we, instead, give each employee ownership over one full slice of the product? For example, say we're building an online system for hospital staff. We get Joe to <em>only</em> focus on "Patient Details". We get Mary to <em>only</em> focus on "Blood Pressure Charts". Etc. etc. Joe gets to hang out and chat with patients, design the interface accordingly, identify and code an appropriate back-end and host the system in the cloud, where scaling is taken care of automatically. Mary does the same, but her focus is on Blood Pressure charts. So she hangs out with doctors, learns their lingo, writes appropriate interface and back-end code, etc. etc.</p>

      <p>Workers get to work on aspects of the product that they're actually interested in! (notice, employee engagement?) Imagine that! Rather than being straight-jacketed into one kind of labour, based on their circumstances, they get to be involved in every aspect of production of one part of a system, including building empathy with the people who will actually <em>use</em> the system!</p>

      <p><strong>Each worker should have ownership and involvement in every important aspect of the slice they're working on, from how customers and users interact with it, all the way through to the code and systems that implement it.</strong></p>
